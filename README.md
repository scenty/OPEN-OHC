# Introduction
The code is for pre-processing, training, testing, and visualization of Ocean Projection and Extension neural Network (OPEN) Ocean Heat Content (OHC) dataset.
The work was submitted to Remote Sensing (Su et al, 2020, accepted).

The code along with OPEN-OHC data will be public available on this git page SOOOOOON after publication of the paper.
Links to the data will also be provided on this page.

The code is for pre-processing, training, testing, and visualization of Ocean Projection and Extension neural Network (OPEN) Ocean Heat Content (OHC) dataset.
The work was submitted to Remote Sensing (Su et al, 2020) under peer-review.

The code along with OPEN-OHC data will be public available on this git page SOOOOOON after publication of the paper.
Links to the data will also be provided on this page.
